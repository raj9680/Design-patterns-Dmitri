GAMMA Categorization

1. Design patterns are typically split into three categories
2. This is called Gamma Categorization after Erich Gamma, one of the author of GoF.

Design Patterns Categories

1. Creational Patterns
- Deal with creation (construction) of objects
- Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
- Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)

2. Structural Patterns
- Concerned with the structure(e.g class members).
- many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
- Stress the importance of good API design.

3. Behavioral Patterns
- They are all different, no central theme.
