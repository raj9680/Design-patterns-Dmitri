=> The Single Responsibility Principle is one of the SOLID design principles. We can define it in the following
ways,

1. A reason to change
2. A class or method should have only one reason to change.
 
Single Responsibility
A class or method should have only a single responsibility.
When a class has more than one responsibility, there are also more reasons to change that class.

=> SRP Benefits
The SRP has many benefits to improve code complexity and maintenance. Some benefits of SRP are following,

1. Reduction in complexity of a code
A code is based on its functionality. A method holds logic for a single functionality or task. So, it reduces the code complexity.
 
2. Increased readability, extensibility, and maintenance
As each method has a single functionality so it is easy to read and maintain. 
 
3. Reusability and reduced error
As code separates based functionality so if the same functionality uses somewhere else in an application then don’t write it again.
 
4. Better testability
In the maintenance, when a functionality changes then we don’t need to test the entire model.
 
5. Reduced coupling
It reduced the dependency code. A method’s code doesn’t depend on other methods.
